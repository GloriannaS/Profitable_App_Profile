    "To have a successful business in any field, accurate processing, organization, and analysis of the business's data is crucial. Recognizing what has been profitable in the past, what needs to be discontinued, and monitoring new additions are all part of a company's advancement, and require detailed attention. As more data is acquired, the need for organization rapidly becomes more urgent. In this project, we will simulate accurate data analysis for a mobile app company."

    "Although the function completed its job, the last two strings we entered were labeled as 'not English' because of the two characters that were not in the English range. If we keep the function the way it is, we stand to lose much useful data. In the code below, we will rewrite our function, but with a few changes to preserve as much useful data as possible. We shall make it so that a string is only labeled as 'not English' if it has more than three non-English characters. If the string has even up to three non-English characters, it will still be labeled as English. While this new function filter is still imperfect, it should be able to get us the majority of the data that we need."

From the order of these genres, we get the impression that most of these apps are designed for enjoyment purposes, while a lesser amount of the apps are designed for practical purposes. The profile we would recommend for the App Store market would be one designed for enjoyment, preferably somewhere around the \"Games\" and \"Entertainment\" genres.

In the 'Genres' column, we have 'Tools' as the highest genre, seconded by 'Entertainment' at 6.0%. Studying the general patterns of these two columns, we can see that the majority of the apps in this dataset are designed for more practical uses, with the lesser percentage given to 'Games' or 'Entertainment'. In comparison with the AppleStore dataset, it is clear that while 'Games' are still high on the list, they are not the main leaning of the Google Play dataset, as is the AppleStore dataset. The recommended app profile these tables give for the Google Play market is one of a more practical genre rather than an entertainment-based genre. However, if we were to recommend an app profile from the data of both tables, it would be one of a more useful, while still entertaining, genre. Like maybe an educational game, for example."

For example, maybe one user could communicate a new road blockage, accident, etc., to other users of the app, making their navigation of the roads more efficient. Or, in another example, maybe one user could alert other users of flight cancelations, sales, or delays, thus making flight navigation faster as well. After determining the final genre, we can recommend a popular mobile app profile that fits the AppleStore and Google Play markets.
